CSI camera interface has control codes

Start of line SOL  0xFF00:0000
End of line EOL    0xFF00:0001
Start of frame SOF 0xFF00:0002
End of frame EOF   0xFF00:0003

All codes starts with 8 ones and 16 zeros. There is not valid RGB pattern that start with this sequency

Data is transmitte from LSB to MSB.
That means two consecutives bytes where the MSB is all 1 and the next has LSB as 1 can produce a control code pattern

Ex
1111111 00000000 0000000 xxxxxx
111111x 00000001 0000000 xxxxx0

fixed 
1111111 00000000 0000001 xxxxxx

made the lsb always 0 will break this pattern or set a 1 on the lsb of 3th byte
